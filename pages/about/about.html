    <article> Hello! My name is Graham and I'm a web developer just dipping his feet into the ocean that is coding. I'm excited to learn and build as much as I can while experimenting with whatever tickles my fancy at the moment. I'll keep adding more to this as I continue on, including links and contact info. Share with me in my journey!</article>
